parsly
======

**WARNING:**
This is currently under (very) active development and I wouldn't recommend using it for anything more than a demo project.

A concise, small, and fast (monadic) parser combinator library for C++11.

Parsly is loosely based on the [Parsnip Parser Library](http://parsnip-parser.sourceforge.net/) which seems to be abandoned as of 2007, and is in disrepair (it doesn't even compile).  Parsnip itself is a C++ port of the [Parsec](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Parsec) Parser combinator library for Haskell.
